# Create Installer Info

- Before you do these steps, make sure to build the application and check that the executable at /dist/Senior-Project/Senior-Project.exe works as desired.
- The script contained at ./installer/Create Installer Script is an Inno Setup script.
- To use the script, you must download Inno Setup (https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php).
- Also in the directory ./installer are two .ico files that are used in the script.
- To create a new installer, either edit the provided .iss script or create a new one using the Inno Setup application (it is quite intuitive).
- If editing the provided .iss script, the only thing that need be changed are the absolute paths (i.e. "C:/Users/chris...").
