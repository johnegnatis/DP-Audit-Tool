## Development Environment Help

[Error Code 1](#error-code-1)

### Error Code 1

If you are getting error code 1 from npm run start (or more specifically: npm run start:eel), this is most likely because eel is not properly installed or pip is not pointing your current version of python. You can check this by doing 'pip list' and looking for eel.
